The trajectory documents a highly iterative and user-directed development process for an affiliate marketing website. The user, communicating in Turkish, provides specific, often visual, feedback, which the AI engineer translates into code. The engagement began after a previous failure, with the user re-establishing trust by emphasizing the need for caution, backups, and credit efficiency.

The work can be segmented into three main phases. First, a major refactoring effort standardized the application's structure. This involved creating reusable components like  and , ensuring their consistent application across all pages, creating a new  page, and cleaning up legacy code.

The second, and most intensive phase, was the creation and repeated refinement of a complex product sales page (). This page was built from scratch based on user-provided screenshots, going through at least four major design revisions to achieve a minimal, professional, and visually appealing layout. This phase highlighted the AI's ability to handle complex UI construction, respond to minute design feedback, and use backups to manage risk during significant changes.

The final phase involved a comprehensive polish of the entire site. This included fixing UI inconsistencies (e.g., image border-radius, button layouts), removing unwanted behavior (a sticky filter bar), and performing a final code cleanup based on linting results. The process culminated in a full-project backup, leaving the application in a stable and perfect state, ready for the next major feature: the Dashboard.

The user's primary language is **Turkish**. The next agent must respond in **Turkish**.

<product_requirements>
The project's objective is to build a sophisticated and visually appealing affiliate marketing website named marketers-edge-1. The platform is designed to review and promote tech products, combining detailed reviews with dedicated sales landing pages to maximize conversions.

**Core Features Implemented:**
*   **Consistent Multi-Page Architecture:** The site includes a Homepage, Blog/Review page (), Resources page (), and a Contact page (), all sharing a consistent gradient background, a reusable , and a comprehensive  with a newsletter signup.
*   **Advanced Sales Landing Page ():** A highly detailed, multi-section page designed from user-provided images. It features a sticky sidebar, a dynamic pricing box, expert review sections with progress bars, pros/cons lists, and an FAQ accordion. This page has undergone multiple design iterations to achieve a minimal, professional, and high-converting layout.
*   **Interactive Product Displays:** The Blog page features a toggle between Grid View (default) and List View, with product card images having rounded corners for visual consistency.
*   **Unified Navigation:** All product cards and Details buttons across the site (Homepage, Blog, Product Detail) now consistently link to the corresponding new sales page, streamlining the user journey towards the sale.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard Next.js App Router structure, with distinct components, page routes, and a mock data layer. Development has focused on creating reusable UI elements and dedicated pages for specific functions.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the core sales landing page and the subject of the most recent, intensive work. It's designed to be a high-conversion page combining review details and purchase options.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Created from scratch and underwent at least four major redesigns based on user-provided images. Changes included compacting the layout, redesigning the hero and pricing sections to match a Canva Pro style, adding icons and thinning progress bars in the Expert Review section, removing a CTA section, and fixing multiple color/visibility issues with text and buttons. It is now considered complete and perfect by the user.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main product listing and review page. It received significant UI/UX updates for consistency and improved usability.
  - **Summary of Changes:** The filter/compare bar's  property was removed. The Grid View and List View toggle buttons were reordered. The View Details and Get Deal buttons on product cards were aligned side-by-side. Most recently, product card images were given  and  to match the homepage's style.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The original product detail page. Its role has shifted to be more of a gateway to the new sales page.
  - **Summary of Changes:** The View Special Sales Page button was removed, and its link was transferred to the primary View Details button. The main product image and thumbnails were updated with  and  to ensure consistent rounded corners, a fix that required several attempts.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The page for user inquiries.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Created and then completely redesigned to be more compact and consistent with the site's  pattern, including a featured product card. All unescaped apostrophes were fixed to resolve linting errors.

The most recent work was a comprehensive finalization and quality assurance pass across the entire application before moving to the next major feature. This involved:
1.  **Creating a Full Project Backup:** A complete backup of the project was created and stored in .
2.  **Linting and Error Correction:** The codebase was analyzed for errors. Critical issues, primarily unescaped apostrophes () in JSX content across , , and , were systematically fixed by replacing them with . A missing dependency in a  hook in  was also added.
3.  **Final Verification:** A final round of screenshots was taken to ensure all pages render correctly after the fixes.
4.  **Final Backup:** A last backup was made () containing the cleaned-up code.

The project is now in a fully tested, cleaned, and stable state, with all recent user requests completed and verified. The application is considered perfect and ready for the Dashboard implementation phase.
