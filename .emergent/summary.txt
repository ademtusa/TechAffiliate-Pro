The trajectory documents the development of a full-stack CMS and Admin Panel for the Usefulio affiliate marketing website. The AI engineer, guided by a Turkish-speaking user, undertook a series of development and debugging tasks.

Initially, the work focused on completing a Master Plan to connect the frontend to the backend. This involved implementing affiliate link click tracking on the public products page. Subsequently, a significant effort was made to internationalize the application by translating all user-facing text from Turkish to English. This was an iterative process, as the user repeatedly found untranslated sections in the Navbar, public Products page, and later the User Dashboard, which the AI then corrected.

The engineer built several key features from scratch, including a Menus Management module and a Media Library, complete with database models (), API routes (), and frontend UI ().

A critical debugging session occurred when the user could not approve new sign-ups. The AI diagnosed a database discrepancy: the application used the  database, while manual user-creation scripts were incorrectly writing to the  database. The AI resolved this by creating a script to add the user to the correct database.

Most recently, the focus shifted to final UI/UX polishing and production preparation. The AI fixed visual bugs, such as unreadable button hover states and awkward layouts in the admin panel. The final user request was to prepare the app for publishing by performing tests, cleaning up unnecessary files, and providing hosting recommendations. The AI was in the process of running a cleanup analysis script to identify temporary test files for deletion.

The user's primary language is **Turkish**. The next agent must respond in **Turkish**.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build and finalize a comprehensive, production-ready Admin Panel and User Dashboard for the Usefulio affiliate marketing website. This CMS must provide the site owner with full control over all dynamic content.

**Core Features:**
*   **Full-Stack CMS:** Admins must have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for all site entities, including Products, Resources, Categories, Users, Testimonials, Site Settings (logo, name), Menus, and Media.
*   **User Management:** A complete user lifecycle system where new users register with a  status and require explicit admin approval (/) to become .
*   **Frontend Integration:** All public-facing content (e.g., Products, Resources, Testimonials, Navbar) must be dynamically populated from the Admin Panel.
*   **Analytics:** Track key metrics like product  and affiliate link .
*   **User Dashboard:** A dedicated, authenticated area for users to manage their profile, favorites, and accessed resources.
*   **Internationalization:** The entire application UI (public, admin, and user dashboards) must be in English for a global audience.

**Implementation Status:**
The core CMS is largely complete. All major modules (Products, Users, Categories, etc.) have been built. The system has been fully translated to English, and a major user approval bug has been fixed. The current focus is on final testing, code cleanup, and preparing for deployment.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Framework:** Next.js 13+ (App Router)
- **Database:** MongoDB, accessed via the  driver. A key issue was identified and fixed regarding multiple database instances ( vs. ).
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js with a Credentials Provider.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) in  and API routes.
- **API:** RESTful APIs built with Next.js API Routes.
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.
- **Image Handling:** Base64 string encoding for image uploads, stored directly in MongoDB.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monolithic Next.js project using the App Router. Backend logic resides in , frontend pages are in , and shared business logic is in .



-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** Core admin interfaces for managing site content.
    -   **Changes:** Major UI/UX overhaul. Added Base64 image upload with preview. Fixed button/icon hover states for better visibility (, ). The image upload section layout was made more compact and visually appealing.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** Handles new user creation.
    -   **Changes:** Debugged to ensure new users are created with  in the correct database (). This was the root of the user approval bug.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** API and UI for managing users.
    -   **Changes:** The frontend was translated to English. The system was debugged to correctly fetch and display all users, including those with  status, after fixing the database discrepancy.

-   ** &  & **
    -   **Importance:** Key public-facing and user-facing components.
    -   **Changes:** All were iteratively translated from Turkish to English to meet the internationalization requirement. The  function was added to  to enable click tracking.

-   **, , **
    -   **Importance:** A complete module built from scratch to manage site navigation.
    -   **Changes:** All three files were newly created to replace a Coming Soon placeholder, providing full CRUD functionality for menu items.

-   ** (temporary script)**
    -   **Importance:** A script created to identify temporary/unnecessary files for deletion before production.
    -   **Changes:** The script was created and then debugged. An incorrect function call  was replaced with the correct  to resolve an import error.

<pending_tasks>
- **Publish Preparation:** Complete the pre-deployment checklist.
  - Delete temporary test scripts identified by .
  - Provide hosting and deployment recommendations to the user.
- **User Dashboard Integration:** While the User Dashboard pages exist, they need to be fully connected to the backend to display user-specific data (e.g., actual favorite products, downloaded resources).
- **Final Testing:** Conduct comprehensive backend and frontend testing as per the user's request before publishing.

<current_work>
The immediate past work focused on preparing the application for production deployment, as requested by the user. This involved a final round of UI/UX fine-tuning and initiating a pre-publish cleanup and testing process.

**Key Recent Actions:**
1.  **UI/UX Fixes:** Addressed minor visual bugs in the Admin Panel. Specifically, button and icon  states were corrected across multiple pages (, , , etc.) to ensure text and icons remain visible. The layout of the image upload component in  was also improved for better aesthetics.
2.  **Production Test Plan:** Updated the  file with a plan for production readiness testing.
3.  **Code Cleanup Analysis:** Created a Node.js script () to scan the project and identify temporary helper scripts (like , , etc.) that are safe to delete before deployment.
4.  **Debugging Cleanup Script:** The  script initially failed due to an  (calling an incorrect function ). The AI successfully debugged this by replacing all instances of  with the correct function name, , in  and .

The task immediately before this summary was the successful debugging of the cleanup script. The system is now ready to re-run the analysis and proceed with the production preparation plan.

<optional_next_step>
Re-run the now-fixed  script to get a definitive list of files to be deleted, and then present the production checklist and hosting recommendations to the user for final approval before taking action.
